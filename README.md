# Animal-Weight-Prediction
# Introduction
The knowledge of weight is necessary to the enhancement of general growth of farm animals as well as for making informed decisions that concern their health, productivity, and yield. Therefore, this work aims at first, automatically collecting body parameters of cattle using images from cameras, and the development of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network models using the Adam optimizer algorithm to predict their weight. The dataset comprises of two breeds of cattle, X and Y.
